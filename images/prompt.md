# Logo
Create a warm, gentle, feminine logo for a Danish spiritual website. 

The core feeling: soft, loving, trustworthy, light, harmonious, mature feminine wisdom (woman in her 60s). 

Main visual elements to combine elegantly:
- A stylized Danish home/house silhouette (simple, cozy, Scandinavian style, not childish)
- A soft glowing heart integrated into or beside the house (subtle golden-white light, not cartoonish)
- Very light energy waves or a gentle aura through the house/heart
- Optional very subtle elements: a tiny shining star, soft light rays, or a faint lotus-like shape

Style:
- Minimalist Scandinavian design meets soft spiritual elegance
- Warm color palette: soft off-white, warm beige, very light gold, pale rose, subtle sage green
- Overall feeling: calm, inviting, healing, professional yet deeply heartfelt

Aspect ratio 1:1 for website logo, transparent background, high resolution, vector-style crisp edges with soft glows, no harsh lines, very high-end and soothing aesthetic
